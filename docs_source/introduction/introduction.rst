Intro.
----------------

we propose a new modular framework for addressing the reality gap in the vision domain and navigating a robot via virtual signals. 
Our robot uses a single monocular camera for navigation, without assuming any usage of LIDAR, stereo camera, or odometry information from the robot. 

Features
--------
- Automatically navigate the robot to a specific goal without any high-cost sensors.
- Based on a single camera and use deep learning methods.
- Use Sim-to-Real technology to eliminate the gap between virtual environment and real world.
- Introduce Virtual guidance to entice the agent to move toward a specific direction.
- Use Reinforcement learning to avoid obstacles while driving through crowds of people.
